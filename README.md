Script to calculate the net area between two scatter plots with differing number of points and x-axis intervals.

The following is an example of two scatter plot lines representing stream cross sections 1 year apart ('start' being the first transect measurement and 'end' being a year later). The goal is to calculate the net difference in area between the two plots to determine the cross-sectional area of stream that was lost in one year. If there is some accumulation (start line higher than end line), this should be deducted from the total reduction amount (start line lower than end line) to end up with a total net loss (negative number).
